Application options are a way to add property values via database. Application options 
are treated as properties and will overwrite the properties already defined with the same key.

## Application parameters screen

To manage application options, you must navigate to `Tools -> Application parameters`.

<img alt="Application parameters screen" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/ApplicationOptions.png')} />

There, you will have a screen where you can add, update or delete the application screens in three
categories:

* **Security**: Security-related properties 
* **Reports**: Report generation properties
* **General**: Other properties
